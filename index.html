<h1>The Definition of Computer Science</h1>
<p>
<strong>Computer Science</strong> is the process of engineering digitally through codes and commands.
<br>
There can be a series of complicated codes just behind one single page of article. The computers'
intelligence is from the commands you acknowledge them. They function manually instead of automatically.
he only time that systems will function manually is when you made a software in them, which is still
manually. Without codes and commands, website can't be made. <br> </br>

<p id="p1text">Html is the brick of computer science and without them, you can't see words and images,
    but only background colors and will only show a blank page. Coders always start with doctype html tag
    and then add a html tag or the computer will not recieve any paragraph spacing or line commands that
    they will have no orders, which can make it harder for the readers to read.

<p id="p2text">CSS is used for decoration. Without CSS, the page will all be black and white, which may not be entertaining for othe browers. CSS is like the paint. And this is also an important step to make your words more orderly and this can also make people like your webiste better.

<p id="p3text">JS is the function such as comment bar and auto moderator than can sense bugs in the website and eliminate them. JS is the animations, where can make the webiste more interesting and more lively, and can also increase the entertainment of reading your article. Without JS, every link will be defualt and no one will like that.
